# Supermarket Queue Simulation (3-phase simulation)

![Alt text](./src/main/resources/readme/simu_results_for_readme.png)

This is a Maven-based Java project for simulating 3-phase systems.
This project models queue behavior in supermarkets using The University of Edinburgh [distributions package](https://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/simjava/distributions/doc/eduni/distributions/package-summary.html),
providing a comprehensive environment for simulating and managing supermarket queues.

## Description

![Alt text](./src/main/resources/readme/implementation_for_readme.png)

The project utilizes Java programming to model queue behavior in supermarkets, integrating several key technologies and tools for development, testing, and management. <br>
These include:

- **Java**: Forms the foundation of the application.
- **Maven**: Key tool for managing dependencies and automating build lifecycle.
- **JavaFX**: Used for creating the user interface.
- **JUnit 5**: Testing framework for ensuring reliability.
- **Hibernate**: ORM tool for simplifying database operations.
- **MariaDB**: Database for storing simulation results.

## GUI

The GUI of the Supermarket Queue Simulation is constructed using FXML and the `View` class,
where the FXML file describes the layout and structure of the user interface. <br>
The manipulation of data and dynamic changes in the GUI are handled by the `Controller` class.

The GUI of the application looks like this:

## Internal Logic

The project includes logic for managing the supermarket queue simulation:

- Dynamic and selectable number of service points (cashiers).
- Tracking of all arrived customers.
- Logic for customers to search for the cashier with the shortest queue.
- Method to save simulation results to the database.

## External Data Repositories

Object relational mapping is used to manage data repositories. <br>
The project includes a dedicated `Result` class for database-related information from the simulation, along with separate `DBConnection` and `Dao` classes.

## Architecture

The project follows the MVC model for structuring, ensuring it's understandable, maintainable, and scalable. <br>
Classes are grouped into relevant packages, including separate packages for database, documentation, and tests. <br>
[Javadoc](https://users.metropolia.fi/~andriid/simulation_javadoc/) provides documentation and description of each class and method in the project.

## Demo

The user-friendly interface allows users to select parameters for simulation. <br>
Various [distributions](https://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/simjava/distributions/doc/eduni/distributions/package-summary.html) have specific requirements for user input. <br>
Error handling (as shown in demo) ensures the backend is resilient to incorrect input.

Simulation results are saved in the database for future reference.

## Testing

Automated tests using JUnit5 cover queue operations, service operations, scenarios with multiple service points, <br>
and distribution characteristics. These tests ensure the reliability and accuracy of the simulation under diverse scenarios.

## Javadoc

Javadoc serves as documentation within the codebase, enhancing code readability. <br>
It categorizes documentation into key sections such as controllers, databases, models, and views, facilitating seamless development.
